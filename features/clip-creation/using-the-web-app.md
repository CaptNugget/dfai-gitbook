# Using the Web App

The Web App is an easy to use portal that allows users to create their own clips through the DeepFakeAI service. To generate a clip:

1.  Navigate to the Web App dashboard at [app.fakeai.io](https://app.fakeai.io/) \

    From here, the clip creation process can begin\

5.  Select one of the many characters available under the character selection dropdown menu\

    \
    Clip creation can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on traffic and clip length, so please be patient!
7.  Enjoy your clip! You can download it via the **Download** button, and preview it right in the built-in viewer. You can also access previously created clips in the **History** tab.\

The **Ask** option works in the same fashion, except you can type in a question you'd like to ask, and the AI will generate a short clip of that character answering the question.&#x20;
