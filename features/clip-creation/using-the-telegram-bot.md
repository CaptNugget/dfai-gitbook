5. Open Telegram signed into your linked account and navigate to
   1. A group chat where the bot as been added (@FakeAI\_io\_bot) or
   2. A new chat directly with the bot
6. Use a command to create a new clip
   1. You can use `/say[character name]`` `_`text you want to be said`_ to create a clip of any character available saying that text. \
      Ex: `/saytate I love DeepFakeAI` will create a clip of Andrew Tate saying "I love DeepFakeAI"
   2. You can use `/ask[character name]`` `_`question you want answered`_ to create a clip of any character answering a question of your choice.\
      Ex: `/asktate What do you think about DeepFakeAI` will generate a clip of Andrew Tate giving his opinion on DeepFakeAI.
7. Enjoy your newly generated clip! The bot will send a message in the channel you are in containing the generated clip, which can be downloaded and shared however you'd like.
