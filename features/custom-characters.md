# Custom Characters

Custom characters can be created for a fee, and can be paid for using either cryptocurrency or fiat currency. Simply select the dollar sign by the Custom Characterâ€™s name in the Custom tab to access the checkout page. Once paid for, the character can be trained. Once training is complete you will be notified via email. Once trained, the character can be used just like any other, and can be viewed and managed under the List portion of the Custom tab.
