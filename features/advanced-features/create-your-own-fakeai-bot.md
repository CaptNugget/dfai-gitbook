### Creating your FakeAI Bot

To create your own FakeAI Bot, begin by creating a Telegram Bot. This can be done by messaging with the [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), from which you must obtain your bot token.

Once you have your bot token, enter it into one of the Bot Token fields on the Bots tab and click the button in the field to save the token.&#x20;

Next, click on the "Select..." button beside your token. This will bring up the "Select Characters" prompt.

In the "Select Characters" prompt, you can search for and select any of the characters available to use with DeepFakeAI, and click "Save" to save your bots character list. You can also click the "Select All" button and click "Save" to give your bot access to all bots available to the service.&#x20;

Congratulations! You've created your new FakeAI bot which you can add to your servers as you wish. Clips generated with this bot will use the minutes from your DeepFakeAI account, so make sure to stay topped up for your server!
