# Roadmap

The current road-map for DeepFakeAI is the following:

* Improved deepfake quality through continued training and refinement of the deep learning algo- rithms and processes
* Further optimizations to ease of use and efficiency of the web app, web API and Telegram bot
* Introduction of the DeepFakeAI bot to new platforms, to expand use-cases across multiple social media sites
* Continued expansion of the Character pool with input from the DeepFakeAI community
* Improvement of the custom Character option through further refinement of the automated Char- acter creation process
* Access to HD options for Custom Characters

These objectives continue to drive the DeepFakeAI team to improve the service, and there is no limit to the possibilities in the future.
