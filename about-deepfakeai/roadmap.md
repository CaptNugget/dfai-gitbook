# Roadmap

The current road-map for DeepFakeAI is the following:

* Improved deepfake quality through continued training and refinement of the deep learning algo- rithms and processes
* Further optimizations to ease of use and efficiency of the web app, web API and Telegram bot
* Introduction of the DeepFakeAI bot to new platforms, to expand use-cases across multiple social media sites
* Continued expansion of the Character pool with input from the DeepFakeAI community
* Improvement of the custom Character option through further refinement of the automated Char- acter creation process and custom refinement for video and audio
* Access to HD options for Custom Characters
* An ”Explore” tab, which will allow users to explore other user’s Custom Characters
* Free Character creation for holders of $FAKEAI
* A new ”Zero Shot” model, which will reduce cost, amount of audio data required and training time significantly for custom characters alike using a new audio training process. These savings will be passed on to the users as lower cost and time to use the service.

These objectives continue to drive the DeepFakeAI team to improve the service, and there is no limit to the possibilities in the future.
